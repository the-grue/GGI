# GGI
Grue's Graphic Interface Library

A graphic interface library based loosely on the Borland Graphic Interface library (BGI)
that will run on open source or hobby OSs.

The goal is to provide API compatibility with BGI without the requirement of separate
driver files.  Compatibility would be through a standard series of variables and/or pointers.
